# **📋 Core Concept**

- Understanding your data is the foundational step in any data analysis. It involves exploring data characteristics, patterns, and relationships to gain actionable insights. Quality data is fundamental—it must be appropriately sourced and cleansed.

# 🔍 Key Questions to Ask Your Data

**1. How big is the data?**

- Check number of rows and columns

- Example: df.shape in pandas returns (rows, columns)

**2. How does the data look?**

- View first/last few rows

- Example: df.head() or df.tail() in pandas

=> Check sample records to understand structure

**3. What is the data type of columns?**

- Identify categorical vs numerical data

- Check date formats, strings, integers, floats

- Example: df.dtypes or df.info() in pandas

**4. Are there any missing values?**

- Identify null/NaN values

- Example: df.isnull().sum() to count missing values per column

- Visualize missing data with heatmaps

**5. How does the data look mathematically?**

- Get statistical summaries

- Example: df.describe() for mean, std, min, max, percentiles

=> Check distributions, outliers

**6. Are there any duplicate values?**

- Identify and handle duplicate rows

- Example: `df.duplicated().sum()` to count duplicates

=> Consider context before removing

**7. How is the correlation between columns?**

- Analyze relationships between variables

- Example: `df.corr()` for correlation matrix

=> Visualize with heatmap or pairplots

**🚀 Next Steps After Data Understanding**

- Data cleaning - handle missing values, outliers, duplicates

- Feature engineering - create new features if needed

- Data transformation - normalization, encoding categorical variables

- Prepare for modeling - train-test split, data pipelines
