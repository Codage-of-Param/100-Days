### **Batch Learning (Offline Learning):****Meaning**:* In batch learning, the model is trained on the **entire dataset at once**. Once trained, the model is deployed and does not update itself unless retrained from scratch with new data.**Advantages**:* Stable and consistent model performance* Easier to implement and debug* Suitable when the dataset is fixed and static**Disadvantages:*** Not suitable for real-time or streaming data* Retraining is time-consuming and computationally expensive* Cannot adapt quickly to changing patterns (concept drift)* Requires large memory and processing power**Real-Life Examples:*** Credit scoring models* Spam classification trained periodically
