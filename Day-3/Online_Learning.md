### **Online learning:**



**Meaning**: 

In online learning, the model learns **incrementally**, **updating itself** one data point or **small batch at a time as new data arrives**.



**Advantages**:



* Adapts quickly to changing data patterns
* Ideal for real-time and streaming data
* *Lower memory requirement*
* Faster updates without full retraining
* Handles concept drift\* effectively



**Disadvantages:**



* Tricky to use
* Model stability can fluctuate 
* *Harder to debug and reproduce results*
* Requires careful tuning of learning rate



**Real-Life Examples**



* Recommendation systems (YouTube, Netflix)
* Stock price prediction
* Fraud detection systems
* Online ad bidding



**When to use:**



1\. Where there is a concept drift\*

2\. Cost effective

3\. Faster solution



We can use **VOWPAL RABBIT** , **RIVER** python library for online learning.



\* **Concept drift** :

\-  Problem nature changes over time is called concept drift.

\-  Example: Stock market
