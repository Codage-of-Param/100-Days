# Machine Learning Notes

## ⚠️ Challenges in Machine Learning

| **Challenge** | **Explanation** | **Example** |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **1. Data Collection / Gathering** | Collecting large, diverse datasets is difficult. | Gathering millions of medical images for cancer detection. |
| **2. Insufficient / Labelled Data** | ML models need annotated data; labeling is costly. | Training a self-driving car requires labeled road scenarios. |
| **3. Non-Representative Data (Sampling Noise)** | Biased or incomplete data leads to poor generalization. | Face recognition failing on underrepresented ethnic groups. |
| **4. Poor Quality Data** | Cleaning/preprocessing consumes ~60% of project time. | Removing duplicates, correcting missing values in e-commerce logs. |
| **5. Irrelevant Features** | Extra/unrelated features reduce accuracy. | Including “customer’s shoe size” in predicting loan approval. |
| **6. Overfitting** | Model learns training data too well, fails on new data. | A spam filter memorizing training emails but misclassifying new ones. |
| **7. Underfitting** | Model too simple, fails to capture patterns. | Linear regression used for complex stock market prediction. |
| **8. Software Integration** | Integrating ML models with legacy systems is tough. | Deploying fraud detection ML into old banking software. |
| **9. Deployment** | Moving from prototype to production is complex. | Scaling recommendation engines for millions of users. |
| **10. Cost Involved** | High computational & infrastructure costs. | Training GPT-like models requires expensive GPUs. |
